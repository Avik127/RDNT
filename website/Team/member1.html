	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and graduating in May 2023. Over the project, first and foremost, I 
    learned strong teamworking skills. Though I was comfortable (and uncomfortable!) with much of the software that I was required to write for product functionality,
    I had to learn how to work with a team to get the product delivered. As the team lead, I often had to integrate everyone's work to create a solid product. 
    I had came into the project with the expectation to just work on the embedded software but I ended up having a hand in almost every single part of the design. 
    This included hardware design (designing the analog circuitry and working on the PCB with Avik), embedded software design, finding suitable models for our 
    input signals (using Gaussian Filtering and FFT), and wiring the final display. I've learned so much that I can't possibly type it all.
