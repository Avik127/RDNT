	<b><u>About:</u></b>
	I'm majoring in Computer Engineering and graduating in May 2023. My focus is on software engineering. I've interned
    at Cleveland-Cliffs as a Process Control Intern. Over that experience, I got to work on and deploy programs for operators
    to interface with different machines. This meant I had to work with existing production data to verify different configurations
    would not harm production. Over this experience, I developed my abilities in working in a small team and producing high-quality
    production code. In this project, I've been spending lots of time on the microcontroller embedded software and trying to keep the team 
    focused on our objective.
