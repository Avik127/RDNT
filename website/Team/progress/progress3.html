      <p class=MsoNormal>Description of Design Efforts:</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>This week, I worked on several initial functions for the
      project. This includes setting up the hardware interface, generating ideas for
      the functional specifications, prototyping these ideas, and starting the
      initial discussion of the final design concept.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>We decided as a team to use ESP32 for our microcontroller. I
      have used it in ECE40862 and presented the benefits of using this
      microcontroller to our teammates. The major selling point was that we had used
      it before, and it was readily available in the lab. Moreover, the in-built
      Bluetooth module was useful for our project, where we may require high-speed
      wireless data transfer. We acquired the ESP32, and I set up the interfacing
      using PlatformIO on VSCode. This made prototyping easier as PlatformIO offers
      control through both Arduino and Espressif IoT Frameworks. This played as a
      major advantage for us, as we were able to focus on quickly prototyping and
      testing our circuitry. We plan on continuing to use this interface.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>I contributed to building and testing the first prototype of
      our microphone circuitry with Graeme. This was a big success as it maps out to
      a potential PSSC and our testing yielded promising results. The figure above
      shows that the microphone can identify sound nearby and recognize certain beats
      and frequencies. However, we also identified major impact of noise, and plan on
      adding a mix of software and hardware filtering to ensure that the microphone
      can distinguish different frequencies within audio input. While the team was
      focused on conducting software filtering, I demonstrated that some level of
      hardware filtering, and focusing on software smoothening, would be beneficial
      to reduce the latency of data transfer, but we must also ensure there is not
      significant data loss.</p>

      alt="A picture containing text, indoor, monitor, computer&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated">I
      also focused on several team tasks such as team discussions and the development
      of a top-level system flowchart with Kahaan.  This allowed us to rethink our
      PSSCs as per the guidelines by the instructor and TA during our last MANLAB. We
      are able to map out the entire project and discuss specific details based on
      this flowchart. We learned that there are several (possibly 100+) PSSCs that
      can be developed, but we must focus on choosing the right 5 specifications that
      would distinguish our device from similar product which can be developed in the
      timeframe of our project. Kahaan and I also worked on prototyping bluetooth
      connection between our microcontroller and a phone app. Secifically, I helped
      him establish a connection with the microcontroller through PlatformIO. While
      this is just a basic test, we will attempt to send data packets for our next
      prototype.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>Throughout this week, I established a fail-faster attitude
      among our group. I learned that the key to move forward is to rapidly prototype
      and learn from the results. There are several technical topics where I had to
      revisit material from previous classes, such as op-amps for the microphone
      filter, Fourier transformation for signal processing, and creating an aux-in
      connection. I believe the key takeaway for me was to collaborate with my
      teammates to quickly learn and prototype. I hope to begin development of the
      final schematic and get started with the PCB design by Week 4.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>Description of Design Efforts:</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>This week I prototyped a lot of our components. I developed a
      DC-DC 12V to 5V voltage regulator, an AUX input for music, and a high-pass
      hardware filter for microphone input. Moreover, I developed code for software
      filtering of microphone input. I also worked with Kahaan on developing code for
      LED output. I worked with Anurag for determining LED input signals and
      understanding bitwise operations. Lastly, I worked with Graeme for exploring
      fast Fourier transform of our audio signal. </p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>To develop the 50Hz high pass filter, I implemented a
      modified version of a <a
      href="https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/filter/filter_6.html">standard design</a>.
      I used the existing LM324 IC that we used for amplification on the microphone
      and modified the gain so that we have a peak-to-peak voltage of 1V. The hardware
      filter was beneficial to filter our environmental noise which resulted from no
      sound input. Therefore, the resulting ADC input involved clearly distinguishable
      values when there was no sound versus when there was sound being played into
      the microphone. The resulting waves will be demonstrated during our next MANLAB,
      but it is simply a filtered variation of our previous result (from Week 2). The
      software filtering fundamentally picks up ADC values when the resulting wave
      presents a voltage level within a certain threshold, thereby filtering out
      higher voltages that are generated from noise. </p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>Thereon, I implemented the AUX input. There is close to no noise
      since it is a wired connection. This would be a good benchmark for our
      microphone input. This was simply a matter of smoothing the raw aux input and
      reading it from an ADC pin. I developed a simple RC circuit to smoothen the values
      and used these to explore the types of signals that we would encounter. I also
      implemented a potentiometer to adjust the ‘volume’, or voltage level, of our
      signal. The RC circuit also ensures that this circuit also has a peak-to-peak
      voltage of 1V so that it is directly comparable to the microphone values.  The
      resulting wave can be seen in the figures below and will also be demonstrated
      in the next MANLAB.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>The DC-DC voltage regulator is similar to what Kahaan has
      demonstrated on his Progress Report. However, we have not tested it with a
      current driver. Our next step would be to use the AD2 to test the power
      regulator circuit. I implemented the circuit from the LM1117 datasheet and
      modified the resistance values to regulate the voltage output. I added a capacitor
      for ripple rejection, based on testing different values from the DC power
      source. I also plan to add a Zener  diode to the circuit to smoothen the
      voltage output for higher current values. The circuit is demonstrated in the figure
      below.</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>I learned about prototyping with circuit components to
      achieve the required signal. I used the oscilloscope, DC power supply, and multimeter,
      comprehensively to select the right components and produce useful signals.
      Moreover, I gained integral knowledge about the sound waves that we receive
      from different instruments in music. This would be beneficial as we are
      developing an algorithm that reacts to different sections and instruments in music
      inputs. </p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

      <p class=MsoNormal>The next steps would be to integrate the circuitry and code
      to develop a fully functional breadboard prototype. We would also work on fine-tuning
      the circuitry to receive optimal data. Concurrently, I am working with Graeme
      on writing code for Fast Fourier Transform to generate useful data, and I am
      working with Kahaan on writing code to use this data to generate LED output
      patterns. </p>

      <p class=MsoNormal><span style='font-size:13.5pt;color:black'>This week was
      more about completing all the structural elements of our design. I focused on
      mainly having conceptual discussions of the final concept with Anurag, Graeme,
      and&nbsp;Kahaan. Our discussions involved the prioritization of work such as
      FFT and I conducted fundamental research to support that.&nbsp;Kahaan&nbsp;and
      I also discussed the implications of our product and talked about the expansion
      of our device into a full-fledged smart LED system. Thereon, I worked on
      developing the schematics of our circuits on&nbsp;KiCAD&nbsp;and verifying functionality
