<p class=MsoNormal>This week, I worked on several initial functions for the
project. This includes setting up the hardware interface, generating ideas for
the functional specifications, prototyping these ideas, and starting the
initial discussion of the final design concept.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>We decided as a team to use ESP32 for our microcontroller. I
have used it in ECE40862 and presented the benefits of using this
microcontroller to our teammates. The major selling point was that we had used
it before, and it was readily available in the lab. Moreover, the in-built
Bluetooth module was useful for our project, where we may require high-speed
wireless data transfer. We acquired the ESP32, and I set up the interfacing
using PlatformIO on VSCode. This made prototyping easier as PlatformIO offers
control through both Arduino and Espressif IoT Frameworks. This played as a
major advantage for us, as we were able to focus on quickly prototyping and
testing our circuitry. We plan on continuing to use this interface.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>I contributed to building and testing the first prototype of
our microphone circuitry with Graeme. This was a big success as it maps out to
a potential PSSC and our testing yielded promising results. The figure above
shows that the microphone can identify sound nearby and recognize certain beats
and frequencies. However, we also identified major impact of noise, and plan on
adding a mix of software and hardware filtering to ensure that the microphone
can distinguish different frequencies within audio input. While the team was
focused on conducting software filtering, I demonstrated that some level of
hardware filtering, and focusing on software smoothening, would be beneficial
to reduce the latency of data transfer, but we must also ensure there is not
significant data loss.</p>

alt="A picture containing text, indoor, monitor, computer&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated">I
also focused on several team tasks such as team discussions and the development
of a top-level system flowchart with Kahaan.  This allowed us to rethink our
PSSCs as per the guidelines by the instructor and TA during our last MANLAB. We
are able to map out the entire project and discuss specific details based on
this flowchart. We learned that there are several (possibly 100+) PSSCs that
can be developed, but we must focus on choosing the right 5 specifications that
would distinguish our device from similar product which can be developed in the
timeframe of our project. Kahaan and I also worked on prototyping bluetooth
connection between our microcontroller and a phone app. Secifically, I helped
him establish a connection with the microcontroller through PlatformIO. While
this is just a basic test, we will attempt to send data packets for our next
prototype.</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoNormal>Throughout this week, I established a fail-faster attitude
among our group. I learned that the key to move forward is to rapidly prototype
and learn from the results. There are several technical topics where I had to
revisit material from previous classes, such as op-amps for the microphone
filter, Fourier transformation for signal processing, and creating an aux-in
connection. I believe the key takeaway for me was to collaborate with my
teammates to quickly learn and prototype. I hope to begin development of the
final schematic and get started with the PCB design by Week 4.</p>
