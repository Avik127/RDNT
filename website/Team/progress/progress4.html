            <h4>Weeks 1-2: Brainstorming for High Voltage DC-DC Converter Circuit and Bluetooth</h4>

			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Description: This week was a brainstorming week. I spend time reading about voltage regulator circuit and thinking about ICs that could be used for making the following circuit for the project. I spent time going through the BluetoothSerial.h for the ESP32. This basically involved going through the current functions available for the code that can be utilized for setting a Bluetooth connection with an app. Additionally, figured the use cases for Classic Bluetooth vs Bluetooth Low Energy. Finally, was able to develop a flowchart on Lucid Chart to put the project possibilities on a piece of paper.</p>
			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;</p>
			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>During this process I learned about Voltage Regulator, Dividers and Buck Converters. The use cases and applications and hence was able to conclude that a regulator is a better use case for our project. In the coming week, I will be devoting time on development of hardware circuit for voltage regulator by ordering the correct components needed. Additionally, I will be performing power calculations with the team based on power requirements based on our sub modules. For Bluetooth connections, I figured that a classic mechanism is higher preferable use case as our device is powered through Wall Plug, Moreover BLE on ESP has tend shown issues with disconnecting with androids. The goal for the coming week is to get hand off Android Studio and start app development, for current prototyping I utilized the MIT app Inventor to get the basic idea. It was achieved using block with the end goal of have a rough estimate over the Bluetooth functionality between android and embedded systems. Finally working on the flowchart gave me well rounded idea about the next few potential places to work on and especially a rough estimate about the time we have to achieve these functionalities.</p>

			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Voltage regulator: I went through multiple resources online and had a discussion with the team about it , finally the goal set was to read more about creating a step-down voltage regulator for our circuit, as we are planning to utilize this for converting 10V/12V to 5V for our ESP32 and even 10V/12V to 5V for our programmable Led. We are currently keeping them on two different power lines, so the ESP32 is operatable even when the user chooses the turn off the LEDs analogous. I took the liberty of researching and pitching of choosing a voltage regulator instead of a divider because, using voltage divider will involve using large value resistors and is 80% less efficient under load. We are not considering a buck converter because we are planning on choosing a wall plug that converts ac to dc.</p>

			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.75in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Potential ICs: LM2678 ,LM7805</p>
			<p style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:107%;font-size:15px;font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>Bluetooth Functionality: So, for the following we will be utilizing references module below to check if we were able to connect to the device using android mobile and control the led device. We had a success with this, we made a basic code that sends 6-bit message from mobile to the esp32 and we used modulus of 10 to separate the 6-bit group to 2 bits where each group corresponds to three buttons on the app. The basic app Interface had three buttons on it and ability to connect and disconnect with the ESP32 and finally the status. We used MIT app inventor for the prototype now we will start coding with Android Studio as our app was operable and able to communicate with the device.</p>

Avik and I took the liberty of making a flow chart that displays the possible routes we can take with the project.

We have added the Finally, to get started with the voltage regulator circuit I had designed a small layout that I would be want to test the following week. &nbsp;</p>
