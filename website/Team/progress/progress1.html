            <h4>Weeks 1-2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1/20/23 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 13 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b>
			<p>This week was mostly spent researching, fleshing out the design, and getting hardware to prototype with.
				First thing I did was get the website hosted and customized for our team. I then reached out to some friends and procured addressable LED strips for prototyping.
				Worked with the team to figure out how to bias the strip for different colors. The ones I was able to get had 4 pins: one each for RGB and 1 for 12V. This proved useful for testing but
				unusable for the final design. I kept looking for hardware we could use for prototyping (microphone, TRRS jack) and worked with Graeme to test out our microphone without amplification.
				Our initial tests were inconclusive as we didn't have the necessary amplification. I was not present for the construction of the amplifier circuit. 
				I then got the prototyping environment set up on my laptop and worked with Graeme to test the ESP32's onboard ADC with signals from the AD2. There was some friction with the IDE as both of us have never
				used PlatformIO and had to troubleshoot out a few bugs before we could read serial communcation (so we could see the ADC readings). The AD2 input signals represented a hypothetical input audio wave.
				I am in the middle of creating a data visualization tool to see how accurate our sampling with the onboard ADC is, but I expect to finish it next week. 
				This tool will tell us if we need to depend on a seperate module for the ADC or we can use the onboard ADC. Spent some time with the other members thinking about how to consolidate the final functionality
				and we settled on the 3 Modes switching from external controls. I did some research into the FFT algorithm that we will need to start working with after we have audio input from the ADC. I also did some research
				on how diodes work to see how useful a Zener Diode will be for stepping power down and to brush up on general operations for driving the LEDs. Finally, worked with the team to finish up documentation required for the course.

				Note: I forgot to take photos this week but I will try to have many for the next weeks.

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 1/27/23 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            Tried getting bluetooth basic connection working. Got it working. Worked out the duty cycle for DATA control for LEDs.
			Worked with PWM outputs to build duty cycle on protype circuit. On Thursday, I got duty cycles working from PWN outputs.
			This allows us to build 0 and 1 inputs to our data pin on the LED.
			On friday, I built some control flows for the 0,1 duty cycle inputs to our data pin. We also got the LED strip in the mail.
			I tried testing the inputs but could not get anything productive to work. I accidentally destroyed 3 LEDs but thankfully I had disconnected
			them from the rest of the strip so everything else is fine. The team was able to use a library for changing the colors of the LEDs, so we will probably not 
			use the duty cycle with PWM for the data pin. Worked on documents with the team.</br>

			<h4>Week 4:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 2/3/23 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 3<br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
            Tuesday, started researching Neopixel and FastLED libraries. Discovered FastLED uses neopixel to drive LEDs. Used FastLED to
			start the basis of our final displays with the LEDs. Got a system working for a series LED configuration with a customizable amount of LED devices. 
			My first idea is to map 5 bins of frequencies to 5 "bins" of LEDs. We will customize internal bins inside our main 5 bins. Then, depending on the frequency
			returned by FFT, we will illuminate the "sub-bins" of the bin that the frequency corresponds to. I did a first mockup of this idea without the 
			changing colors for sub-bins as I have not calculated that yet. As our FFT was not completed yet, I used randomly generated numbers for frequency.
			I have attached a .gif of this test. Note there are 4 LEDs in the gif, but the program will probably end up using multiples of 5.
			At some point, we will likely not use the library and instead use the old PWM signals I was working on. But right now, we are trying to get
			as much possible working as fast as possible.
		
			Wednesday, I realized that I had not considered the cases in which users have less than 5 LEDs connected. I made some changes to my algorihm.
			 I am still working to create the seperation of colors inside of "sub-bins". Note for the second test, I removed the randomly generated frequencies and instead
			put one frequency for each bin for bins 1-5. You cannot see the 5th bin as there are only 4 connected (proof of &#605 working). 
		
			Thursday, came into lab. Started realizing we need a beat detection algorithm. Researched this instead of continuing the different output modes.
		Different output modes for prototyping are still useful, but only 1 is required for full prototyping. The next output modes I will build will be for parallel configurations
	and one in which there are no 5 LED "bins" and instead ALL the LEDs flash the corresponding frequency color.
