			<h2>Progress Report for Graeme Usman</h2>
			<h4>Week 14:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 21 April 2023 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 20 <br>
			With our deadline quickly approaching, we came into this week incredibly stressed, as we did not have a working power circuit coming into this week. We decided that spending
			time soldering another whole PCB would be a waste of time and resources. Instead, Anurag and I began to divide up the workload required to produce a presentable project for 
			the full demo at the end of the week; I would be in charge of the entire frame assempbly portion and he would take up programming portion. We both would come together to work 
			our persisting power problems, switching on and off between the two of us whenever we could. 
			Last Friday, I had scheduled an appointment at Bechtel to get our large acrylic slab cut down to size Monday afternoon. 
			<div id="">

			</div>
			After cutting down our acrylic, I went to lab to begin my woodworking journey. After making some adjustments to our final plan for time constraint reasons, I began working towards
			our final LED frame.
			<div id=""> 
				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/planning_the_fixture.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			Much of my week was spent working on the frame of the project, as there was a lot of planning and measuring that needed to be done in order to get the frame as accurate as possible.
			Here are the progress pictures of the frame I took at the end of each day:
			Tuesday:

			</div>
			Thursday:

				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/frame_update_thurs.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			Throughout the week while working on the wood frame, I also assited Anurag with soldering the LEDs' power cables together and attaching an LDO for as a substitute for our
			broken power circuit. We ran into an issue on Wednesday with our PCB sending 5V to some parts of the circuit, but not the others. We fixed this issue by flywiring a cable on the
			bottom side of our PCB. And so, with the 5V issue solved and LDO added to the board, we were able to drive LEDs and MCU with one power source, which was all from our wall power adapter.

			After hours measuring, drilling, and sanding, I finally finished the frame on Thursday. Anurag and Kahaan worked out all the issues in the code regarding lighting late that night/early
			Friday morning. I helped with cable management a little before noon today, and we finally have our project complete.

			<h2>Progress Report for Graeme Usman</h2>
			<h4>Week 13:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 14 April 2023 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 15 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			After our smoking circuit scare last Friday, we spent the next few days attempting to figure out the source of the problem. We reconvened early Saturday afternoon, with the 
			plan to remove the power circuit's IC and capacitor, as well as our 1 ohm resistor that connects our analog and digital grounds together. When I went to remove the capacitor, the
			solder pad came off with it, and due to its size, this made it virtually impossible to resolder. We were stuck in a difficult spot; we weren't entirely sure what the issue was at first,
			as from Avik's initial assessment and talk with Joe they both thought it was the power circuit that was the issue, which is why we deconstructed the power circuit in the first place.
			However, we knew that with no real evidence, it would be a waste of time and components to commit to making another power circuit with no real reason to believe it would work again, so
			instead we decided to wait until Monday to ask someone who might be able to diagnose our problem better. To make use of our time on Saturday, we instead resoldered a new 1 ohm resistor,
			and removed any component in the power circuit that connected 5V and 3.3V together, with the plan to try each voltage level individually to see which one the problem part was on.
			<div id=""> 
				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/PCB_separate_power_test.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			With this a wire coming off where the inductor used to be, we could use the power supply to power either 5V or 3.3V individually to see what was burning up. However, upon testing each
			source individually, nothing seemed to be giving us an issue, but when we powered up both, that is when the 1 ohm resistor went up in smoke. Now we knew that we could not power both at
			the same time, but each worked individually. We were afraid to cause anymore damage to our board before we had any real answer as to why, and so we made plans to come early Monday after 
			class to ask some questions. 
			<div> 
			</div>
			On Sunday, Anurag and I went to the Home Depot in Lafayette to pick up some materials that we would be using to create our final housing and LED display. We will deal with the reimbursement
			process later. 
			<div> 
			</div>
			On Monday morning I was able to get an idea of what the issue was from Joe, which was that there was short between 5V and 3.3V somewhere, but after testing it with a multimeter, we were not
			able to locate the problem. In order to rule out something, Kahaan and I attempted to talk to the ESP-32 on our board. We quickly learned that the MCU was most likely burnt out after we blew
			through a few more 1 ohm resistors. I left a bit after Joe removed our dead MCU, leaving Kahaan and Avik, who showed up a little later, to resolder the chip to the board.
			Tuesday was the day where we were able to locate the issue after some more discussion with Joe and Kahaan. We were running into an issue where something connected to 5V was causing the power
			supply to not send a full 5V through, and after some assistance from Joe we found it was our TMUX that I soldered upside down, causing the GND pin and 5V pins to be in the opposite positions.
			This was the source of our short between 3.3V and 5V! After salvaging another TMUX from our prototyping breadboard, we resoldered the TMUX correctly, and we were finally able to send 5V and 3.3V
			without something smoking, as well as load code to the new ESP-32.

			</div>
			With the PCB no longer a danger, I set my sights on finishing the final LED display on Thursday. With some help from the ECE Machine Shop downstairs, I got my planks cut down to size and planned
			out how everything would be put together. I needed to figure out the dimensions of the display so I know what dimensions are needed when we get our acrylic laser cut at Bechtel.

			</div>
			I came in on Friday for a little bit to assist Anurag and Kahaan; I set up the board so we could successfully amplify our microphone's signal, as well as send in an AUX audio input. The rest 
			of the sampling needed by the MCU, as well as switching between inputs on the TMUX are now in their hands while I continue to finish the final display.

			<h4>Week 12:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 7 April 2023 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 10 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			Another week where my main progress is made by soldering the PCB. After leaving the PCB powered on overnight last Friday with no real issues, we were hopeful that the circuit
			was functional. On Tuesday, Avik and I spent a good portion verifying each connection of the power circuit, since I was worried that the 5V was not being converted down to 3.3.
			After some testing, we figured out that it was the inductor that was not making a full connection, and Joe was able to fix that issue for me quickly. 
			Once that was sorted out, Anurag and I focused on trying to load his newly written code onto our second PCB that has just a CPU and two buttons to boot and load code. I quickly
			soldered a wire to the VCC trace closest to the MCU on the decoupling capacitor so we could power the MCU directly, as there is no power circuit to power it yet. 
			<div id=""> 
				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/PCB_code_testing.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			After this was done we were able to successfully load Anurag's testing code to the MCU through our ECE362 USB UART connector on a separate breadboard that we wired to power the PCB
			and LED strip. 
			<div id="">

				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/PCB_UART_LED_on.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			Once our testing board was able to load code, I spent the rest of my time focusing on finishing the production board with our power circuit on it. I was able to solder pretty
			much everything without issue, minus the microphone, as I am not entirely sure if the soldering iron is too hot for it or not. According to the datasheet you cannot touch anything
			hotter than 270°C for more than 2 seconds on its leads. Thankfully, we have three more microphones we can solder, and it's not difficult to put on and off of the PCB if it comes down
			to it. I was finally able to go off on my own to finish soldering the whole board throughout the week, since we have been at the mercy of the United State Postal System for the past 
			2 weeks as some required parts come trickling in, package by package.

				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/microphone_soldered" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			Anurag also found an issue while working on the mode switching code on the other PCB, where our signal for the third button (which we have also been waiting for for a week), does not 
			go into our MCU, due to some outdated names we had from our previous PCB/schematic version. This required us to flywire directly onto the pin of the MCU, which is the green wire
			you can see in the pictures that cross over the MCU. 
			For next week, we have to test and verify that the rest of the circuits work, as well as get back on track to finish the final production housing and LED display.

			<h4>Week 11:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 31 March 2023 <br>

            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			This week was spent soldering the PCB again, however, much of this week was reliant on our parts being delivered which did not fully come in until late Thursday afternoon. So 
			for Tuesday and Wendesday, I instead took another PCB that we had made and soldered just an MCU to it, as we have 2 ESP-32s. My plan was to get some more practice on soldering the
			MCU to the PCB, and also have this board for testing the MCU while we wait for our power circuit's parts to come in. I soldered the MCU, two push buttons for debugging, and some wires
			coming out of the TX and RX pins for loading code, at Anurag's request, as well as all the related capacitors and resistors. We wanted to follow the recommended process for verifying our
			PCB, which asks to test our power circuit for a full day before even touching the MCU, but we are just limited by the U.S. Postal Service if we do so. So we thought that making two boards
			would be a good idea, since we can test the MCU separately before the power circuit is fully complete.

			</div>

			The parts that we needed to complete our power circuit finally came in late Thursday afternoon, so I was able to quickly finish up that circuit as well. I attached the last tiny
			capacitor and inductor that we needed, as well as the power connector. From there, me and Anurag set it up to run overnight on 5V power, as per the recommended verification process.

			</div>

			I also completed the required Bechtel saftey quizzes needed to use the facility, but we are still working to get the needed hardware from Home Depot, but that is something
			for us to tackle once the PCB is completely confirmed to be functional.

			<h4>Week 10:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 24 March 2023 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 8 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			This Tuesday after manlab, Anurag and I began the process of getting access to the Bechtel Design Center's resources and workspaces. We talked to a few of the 
			consultants there about the specifics of our project. We need the ability to cut a large piece of acrylic down into smaller pieces that we will use to diffuse 
			our LEDs to make it look more uniform and presentable, but we didn't really know where to start when it comes to actually cutting acrylic due to the physical properties 
			of acrylic. This was the main question that we asked a few people about, who then directed us to the Printing & Prototyping department who have access to a laser cutter,
			which was believed to be the best tool to use for cutting acrylic of our specific dimensions. We also were recommended to also talk to the Woodworking department, as the 
			other half of our design requires some precise cutting of wood in order to incorporate the acrylic pieces together with the wood frame. We began the process of gaining 
			access to the tools that Bechtel has by submitting a project proposal, as well as the safety quizzes we need to pass to be able to use them.
			
			My Thursday and Friday were spent beginning the process of soldering together the PCB, which finally came in on Wednesday due to some confusion during delivery. However, 
			some of the board components that we purchased have not come in yet and we also accidentally ordered the wrong inductor, so to minimize any future confusion, me and Anurag
			cataloged what we have already ordered, what is correct, what is incorrect, and what we need to order. After that, we ordered another set of parts that should be in early next,
			so by then I hope to be done soldering the rest of the board. 

			Given that I couldn't fully solder the board this week, I instead tried to get some practice on one of the five PCBs that we have by soldering with the components that we do
			have, which is pretty much all of the power circuit. To my surprise, the smallest components that our design needs is actually in the power circuit, and I learned the hard way
			how difficult it is to solder tiny capacitors by hand. It is definitely doable by me, as the alternative to it would have to be ordering a whole new PCB, which we do not want to 
			have to do again.

            <b>Total hours:</b> 25 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			Our presentation during Week 8 was on Thursday, so much of my effort for this class was spent working on the presentation up until Thursday. I worked on the slides for project overview, 
			component choice, designed the block diagram and refined it with Anurag, prototyping, and schematic. 
			
			After the presentation, we took the feedback of our design and began fixing, adding, or completely redesigning almost every part of our cricuit. Over Friday and Saturday, I was able to 
			solder the correct TMUX that we will be using for our design. From there, I was able to confirm that I did not burn it out during the soldering process, and prove its functionality 
			by sending in an analog signal from the AD2, a song through our AUX jack, and the third input was just grounded (but this is where the Bluetooth-DAC output will be going through). 
			By sending a high voltage through the select lines in different combinations, I was able to see that the inputs were changing depending on what select lines where high or low. 
			<div id=""> 
				<img src="Team/progress/progress2pics/TMUX_circuit.jpg" width=50% height=auto></img>
			</div>
			On Monday, the team decided that the multiple iterations of our op amp circuit was too cumbersome to keep changing layouts and resistor/capacitor values, so we decided to (try to) use 
			LTSpice to try and simulate what is best. On Tuesday, Anurag and I began prototyping a new microphone circuit, testing it with our MUX, and I kept updating our scehmatic. I wired together a
			debouced button circuit we could use for our input mode select, and added a JTAG Programming header to our schematic.

			On Thursday, Anurag had finished building a microphone circuit, and when I came in we verified the circuit and the equations he used to find values. He and I then went and 
			revised some resistor and capacitor values by reading the oscilliscope so it would be readable by the ADC while also being safe for the pins to take in. With the microphone 
			finally decided on and tested, we added it to our schematic, as well as some more needed changes.

            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			I was not able to work as much as I planned to this week due to some assignments and exams for other classes. However, I was able to learn from Joe to solder very small ICs that we
			will eventually need to know how to do once our PCB has been manufactured. I was able to solder an analog MUX to a dev board using the solder station and a microscope, although the
			result was a bit messy, the experience using other resources OTHER than the soldering iron was very nice to have been able to work with. Once the MUX was fully soldered to the dev 
			board I set it up on a breadboard for testing, as we will need to plan out the circuitry for our input switching. The IC that I soldered is the not the same model that we are planning 
			to use, but it is both good practice for soldering, as well as for testing how we eventually want our circuit to behave. 
			I also forgot to take pictures this week, which is again my fault.

			Unfortunately, this week did not have much progress done on my behalf due to an illness (thankfully not COVID) I had contracted the Saturday prior, as well as attempting to study for  
			through said illness. It took about 5 days for symptoms to subside completely, and it was hard for me to find energy to spend on Senior Design this week. Thankfully, my teammates were 
			very understanding and were able to pick up my slack. On Friday, I felt well enough to work, so me an Anurag took a trip to Home Depot to gather a list of materials we wanted to use for 
			a prototype of our final design.

			My job of implementing the FFT algorithm through the arduino framework seemed to have hit a wall after we found the upper limit of our microcontroller and code experimentally. Me, Avik, and 
			Anurag spent a good amount of time trying to figure out how fast our microcontroller takes to read an analog input through an ADC pin and save it to an array which would be sent to the 
			FFT process. This was because we had a hunch that we were losing samples during the time it takes from sampling through the pin, but the results of each of our different tests didn't seem 
			to give us any useful information. Ultimately the results were inconclusive and we didn't really know if what were getting was true, accurate, or useful. Instead of spending more time
			on this problem in arduino, which we all agreed could be a major issue, we decided to move on to learning how to code in the espressif framework. The documentation available is thorough, but
			difficult to parse and really make sense of, so we are making progress, slowly but surely.
			<div id="Oh boy, I can't wait to learn Espressif">

			</div>
			As the weeks start to pass, we began to realize our project required a lot more design detail to be ironed out. Today, me and Anurag spent some time putting the physical design of the entire
			project on to paper, metaphorically speaking; we actually put it all on our blackboard. We updated our PSSC's and Project Overview Description on the Team Website, as well as made plans
			to build a small scale version of our final design to see if we like the way it looks.

			I unfortunately did not have the foresight to take many pictures this week, as I spent most of it wading through documentation and forum posts that were loosely related to the issues that 
			we were running into, but to no avail. I hope that next week we can at least get ADC sampling working in the ESP-IDF, if not the entire FFT algorithm, as I did come across some information
			of some built-in functionality provided in the ESP-IDF's libraries.

			This week's efforts was effectively a continuation from last week, which consisted of me solely working on our FFT function which was behaving strangely. I figured out the seemingly
			random behavior of the peak frequency output was actually consistently incorrect, which just means it is correct, but with an asterisk.

			By sending a sine wave from the AD2 with a known frequency, I saw that the values returned were off by a factor of about 3.26. This was fine if it stay consistently incorrect, because 
			we know that is doing what it is supposed to, however, it does effectively reduce our usable frequency range down by about a third. This is unfortunate, but workable. I spent a good
			amount of time trying to figure out where this seemingly arbitrary 3.26 value came from, but to no avail.

			With a small change to my code, I was able to put together a rudimentary frequency beat detector. This is the basis for putting together the FFT proccess with the reactive LED process,
			but that is for another day.

			Frustrated with this 3.26 fiasco, I decided to try and implement a different FFT library, citing the original arduinoFFT library as its motivation. This new library was built on 
			another library originally coded for the ESP-IDF and modified for arduino, so my thought process was "learn this one and transition easily into the ESP-IDF". I am currently in the midst
			of writing more code around this new library. Even if this comes with similar issues as the previous library, I hope that coding around similarly functioning libraries allows me to 
			understand what is going on under the hood more. I have already spent a decent amount of time trying to learn arduinoFFT, so hopefully that gives me a head-start when trying to learn this 
			new one as well.

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 27 January 2023 <br>

			This week's time was spent dedicated to learning about and implementing Fast Fourier Transforms to our design, since our implementation of the electret microphone from last week
			was fairly successful, as well as the addition of our 3.5 mm TRRS jack to our design by Avik. My first attempt at utilizing an FFT <a href="https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT">library</a><br>
			was admittedly a bit ambitious; I tried to get an analog input from music playing through the 3.5 mm AUX and trying to perform FFT's on that signal. This obviously did not go smoothly,
			but the issues that I ran into forced me to take a step back and try to figure out each moving part in a more methodical manner, building up from what I know (or thought I knew).

			</div>
			My first challenge was trying to interpret what the FFT was actually doing under the hood, so with some example code that had a working implementation of the library, 
			and the .cpp file of the library itself, I tried to associate different frequency with the indices of the array that my audio was being sampled into. However, the values were still
			too erratic and were not easily understandable. My second attempt was to send a known signal into the ADC pin, since we had already proven this worked last week. Using the AD2,
			I sent in a 1kHz singal into the ADC, and attempted to make sense of the values that was being outputted. Me and Avik spent a good portion of the day trying to understand why the FFT was
			returning a peak value at a frequency that was nowhere close to the frequency of the AD2's wave.

			</div>
			My current attempt is sending in a wave that is offset by 1.15V, to avoid the ESP32's ADC pins' limitation of being able to read voltage values of 150mV-2450mV, as well as 
		    getting negative values all together. I feel like I am on the right track, but the only real way to confirm my understanding is to just keep on trying.

			The past two weeks were mainly used to gather our thoughts and put them in a comprehesible manner. I spent much of the first week researching the plausibility of our
			project and what approach we should take to make it work as smoothly as possible. 
			Much of my contribution for the first week was organizational and research, organizing our Discord server that serves as the main point of communication to be more 
			easily accessible and navigable. For research, I spent time (re-)learning about Fourier Transforms, which will be our main process that allows us to synchronize lights to music,
			as well as looking into the different parts of our design and how we should approach integrating them step by step. 
			As a team we began to paint a clearer picture of our project and aligned on a lot of design ideas, as well as splitting up our goals each day.  
			During the second week, we took a much more hands-on approach: we were able to setup the environment to write code to our microcontroller. We set up some very basic code to read 
			an analog input to the circuit, which we then sent an wave generator output from an AD2 into the microcontroller. We built an amplifier circuit that would allow us to get 
			visible values from an electret microphone, which we also were able to wire into the ADC pin of our microcontroller and read values the same way we read the AD2 wave gen.
