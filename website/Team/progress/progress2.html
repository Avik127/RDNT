            <h4>Weeks 1-2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 20 January 2023 -<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 16 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			The past two weeks were mainly used to gather our thoughts and put them in a comprehesible manner. I spent much of the first week researching the plausibility of our
			project and what approach we should take to make it work as smoothly as possible. 
			Much of my contribution for the first week was organizational and research, organizing our Discord server that serves as the main point of communication to be more 
			easily accessible and navigable. For research, I spent time (re-)learning about Fourier Transforms, which will be our main process that allows us to synchronize lights to music,
			as well as looking into the different parts of our design and how we should approach integrating them step by step. 
			As a team we began to paint a clearer picture of our project and aligned on a lot of design ideas, as well as splitting up our goals each day.  
			During the second week, we took a much more hands-on approach: we were able to setup the environment to write code to our microcontroller. We set up some very basic code to read 
			an analog input to the circuit, which we then sent an wave generator output from an AD2 into the microcontroller. We built an amplifier circuit that would allow us to get 
			visible values from an electret microphone, which we also were able to wire into the ADC pin of our microcontroller and read values the same way we read the AD2 wave gen.

            <h4>Week 3:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 27 January 2023 <br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 7 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			This week's time was spent dedicated to learning about and implementing Fast Fourier Transforms to our design, since our implementation of the electret microphone from last week
			was fairly successful, as well as the addition of our 3.5 mm TRRS jack to our design by Avik. My first attempt at utilizing an FFT <a href="https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT">library</a><br>
			was admittedly a bit ambitious; I tried to get an analog input from music playing through the 3.5 mm AUX and trying to perform FFT's on that signal. This obviously did not go smoothly,
			but the issues that I ran into forced me to take a step back and try to figure out each moving part in a more methodical manner, building up from what I know (or thought I knew).

			</div>
			My first challenge was trying to interpret what the FFT was actually doing under the hood, so with some example code that had a working implementation of the library, 
			and the .cpp file of the library itself, I tried to associate different frequency with the indices of the array that my audio was being sampled into. However, the values were still
			too erratic and were not easily understandable. My second attempt was to send a known signal into the ADC pin, since we had already proven this worked last week. Using the AD2,
			I sent in a 1kHz singal into the ADC, and attempted to make sense of the values that was being outputted. Me and Avik spent a good portion of the day trying to understand why the FFT was
			returning a peak value at a frequency that was nowhere close to the frequency of the AD2's wave.

			</div>
			My current attempt is sending in a wave that is offset by 1.15V, to avoid the ESP32's ADC pins' limitation of being able to read voltage values of 150mV-2450mV, as well as 
		    getting negative values all together. I feel like I am on the right track, but the only real way to confirm my understanding is to just keep on trying.
