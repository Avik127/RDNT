This is an example weekly progress report document that team members can use to report their individual progress 
of their ECE477 senior design projects. Weekly progress reports are expected to follow the general guidelines
presented in the "Progress Report Policy" document, posted on Brightspace.  

Please create 4 copies of this example, renaming each copy to <PurdueID>.html, where <PurdueID> corresponds to
the Purdue ITAP Career Account ID given by Purdue to each individual team member. If you have any questions,
contact course staff.

            <h4>Weeks 1-2:</h4>
            <b>Date:</b> 20 January 2023 -<br>
            <b>Total hours:</b> 50 <br>
            <b>Description of project design efforts:</b><br>
			The past two weeks were mainly used to gather our thoughts and put them in a comprehesible manner. I spent much of the first week researching the plausibility of our
			project and what approach we should take to make it work as smoothly as possible. 
			Much of my contribution for the first week was organizational and research, organizing our Discord server that serves as the main point of communication to be more 
			easily accessible and navigable. For research, I spent time (re-)learning about Fourier Transforms, which will be our main process that allows us to synchronize lights to music,
			as well as looking into the different parts of our design and how we should approach integrating them step by step. 
			As a team we began to paint a clearer picture of our project and aligned on a lot of design ideas, as well as splitting up our goals each day.  
			During the second week, we took a much more hands-on approach: we were able to setup the environment to write code to our microcontroller. We set up some very basic code to read 
			an analog input to the circuit, which we then sent an wave generator output from an AD2 into the microcontroller. We built an amplifier circuit that would allow us to get 
			visible values from an electret microphone, which we also were able to wire into the ADC pin of our microcontroller and read values the same way we read the AD2 wave gen.
