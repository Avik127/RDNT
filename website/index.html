            <h2>Project Name: <b>RDNT</b></h2>
			
            <h2>Project Description:</h2> 
			 RDNT (spoken as Radiant), is a project that takes an input audio source and runs signal processing algorithms to drive wired LED
			 strips to create a synchronized audio-visual experience. These audio sources are an onboard analog microphone, an AUX-in port, and a Bluetooth 
			 signal from our associated Android app. The user will be able to toggle through the 3 modes, with the microphone being the default, by pressing an
			 external button. This mode toggling will be achieved through a multiplexxed circuit that selects the current mode.
			 <br>
			 The signal processing algorithms that will be used are the FFT algorithm and a 1-D Gaussian filter. The Gaussian filter reduces
			 noise on the input sample and the FFT algorithm uses this noise reduced signal to isolate frequencies. The LED strips will be driven by a message sender 
			 that accepts the output of FFT to create patterns on the wired LED strips. 
			 <br>
			 To create patterns we will send PWM signals to the data pin of the LED strips, these patterns and their associated color ranges can be selected by the user 
			 using the associated Android app. 
			 The microcontroller will read input samples and compute signal processing algorithms to drive the message sender.
			 The LED strips will be powered by a wall adapter from 120V AC to 5V DC.
			 A switching regulator circuit will drop the 5V DC to 3.3V DC for our microcontroller.
			 
			 For demonstration purposes, we will construct an acrylic display.
			 
            
            <h2>Project Specific Success Criteria (PSSCs):</h2>   
                <ol>
                    <li>PSSC #1 (Software): The ability to reduce noise on analog inputs through the use of a 1-D Gaussian Filtering algorithm.
					</li>
					<li>PSSC #2 (Software): The ability to control and configure multiple connected LED devices through an in-built Bluetooth module that connects with an Android app.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #3 (Hardware): The ability to amplify and filter analog input of the microphone using a sequence of operational amplifiers.
					</li>
					<li>PSSC #4 (Hardware): The ability for the user to toggle between input modes by using multiplexxed external controls. These modes will be Microphone (default),
						AUX-in, and Bluetooth.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #5 (Hardware): The ability to drive multiple WS2812B LED strips with PWM signals and reactively display patterns in response to audio signals.
