            <h2>Project Name: <b>RDNT</b></h2>
			
            <h2>Project Description:</h2> RDNT is a project that takes an input audio source and runs signal processing algorithms to communicate with LED devices to create a synchronized audio-visual experience. Our device will create communication channels between LED devices and the microcontroller and from an input audio source to external speakers. Signal processing of an input audio source will be done by the microcontroller, which controls the LED devices based on preset behavior. The preset behaviors can be changed by the end user through a connected application that will feature external controls that will be used to select color ranges and maintain connections to LED devices.
            
            <h2>Project Specific Success Criteria (PSSCs):</h2> First Draft is from your Final Project Proposal and you may change your PSSCs at will over the first 5 weeks of the course.  At least 3 must be hardware PSSCs (indicate).  Delete this text and only list your 5 PSSCs.  
                <ol>
                    <li>PSSC #1 (Software): The ability of our LED devices to be controlled (enabled and disabled) by a mobile device, verified through the demonstration of visual effects in response to inputs from the mobile device.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #2 (Hardware): The ability of our LED devices to respond to audio inputs, demonstrated by visual effects in response to music inputs from the mobile device.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #3 (Hardware): The ability of our device to provide a synchronized visual output with LEDs.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #4 (Hardware): The ability of our device to adapt to specific frequencies in musical inputs and generate a visual response based on the tempo of specific frequencies.
					</li>
                    <li>PSSC #5 (Hardware): The ability to regulate power to drive the LED strips, the microcontroller, and external peripherals.
					</li>
